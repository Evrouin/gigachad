Shift your weight to your heels and push your hips back towards the wall behind you while you hinge forward at the hips. To get a better idea of how to do this, think about sticking your butt out behind you. As you hinge, the dowel should not lose contact with those three points. If it does, you know you’re doing the move incorrectly. Lower your torso until it’s midway between vertical and parallel to the floor. Pause. Keep a slight bend in your knees during the downward and upward phase. Reverse the movement by contracting your glutes and pushing your hips forward and upward to return to the starting position. "

As you get to the top of the push up, shift your weight onto your left hand and lift your right arm up, rotating through the spine and shoulders into a side plank position with your arms."

As this happens, jump your legs in underneath you, landing with your feet at shoulder width. Transfer your bodyweight back into your legs and stand up as if you are doing the upward part of a squat. As you stand up jump up and clap your hands above your head.\nAs you land back down, go straight into your next burpee by crouching down and putting your hands back to the floor."
