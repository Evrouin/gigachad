Then jump your feet out to the sides so they are about one meter apart, at the same time, swing your arms out to the sides and up above your head. Keep a slight bend at your elbows. As soon as your feet land out to the sides, jump them back in together and swing your arms back to your sides. Repeat this syncronized movement of the legs in and out and arms swinging out sideways up and down."},{"name":"Hyperextension","description":"14 reps","gif":"back-extensions.gif","steps":" Lie face down on a hyperextension bench. Tuck your ankles securely under the footpads. Adjust the upper pad if you can so that your upper thighs lie flat across the wide pad. Leave enough room so that you can bend forward from the waist without restriction. While keeping your body straight, cross your arms in front of you. This is the starting position. Bend forward slowly from the waist as far as you can. Keep your back flat as you do so. Continue moving forward until you feel a stretch on your hamstrings and you can\'t continue doing so without rounding your back. Raise your torso back to the starting position, inhaling as you do so.

Then lift your hips and walk your feet in closer to your hands so that your body forms an upside down V. Your legs and arms should stay as straight as possible. From here, bend your elbows and lower your upper body down and forwards, until the top of your head nearly touches the floor. Your head should be infront of your hands once your elbows bend. Imagine, your hands are the bottom two points of a triangle, and your head moves forward as you lower down to make the top point of the triangle. From the bottom position, push down into the floor hard with your hands and keep your elbows in close to your body to straighten your arms and return to the start position. Make sure that as you push your body upwards, you maintain the angle at your hips rather than pressing your chest away from the floor and collapsing at the hips."},{"name":"Reverse Pushups","description":"12 reps","gif":"pike-push-ups.gif","steps":"Instead of having your hands on the floor, place your hands behind you on a bench or sturdy chair.

Keeping your legs as straight as you can to really stretch out your hamstrings, bend forwards from the hips until your fingers touch down underneath your shoulders.

Your heals will lift up off the floor and you will rock up on to your toes, but your feet don’t move forwards. Keep walking your hands out until you are in a high plank position with your hands underneath your shoulders (or the top of the push-up position). Make sure your hips don’t drop below the straight line of your head down to your heals. From this high plank position, push your hips up and back as you walk your hands back in towards your feet.
